This letter is to inform you of an inspection of the property on 10-13-18.


We need you  to allow the representative into this unit and take whatever picture he needs for the inspection.


There will be a  $ 1000.00 fine if we find out that you do not allow him to enter the premises.


He is scheduled to be there Monday 10-13-18 at 12:00 noon.


He will take about 15 minutes  to complete this inspection of your unit.


We appreciate your cooperation with this request.




Thanks again,


Primavera IC
