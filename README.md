# Property Management App for Primavera

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

## About the Project

This project, started on 6/1/2025, was built as a side project to learn app development as a way of aiding the file management and property management of the Primavera group, private group that still uses old school physical file cabinets. 

With a focus on simplicity, this apps to make file storing and creating as simple and straight-forward as possible. 

## Current State of the Project

Last Updated: 6/3/2025

The application allows for addition, deletion, and modification of tenants. The next goal is to be able to add files associated with each tenant. From there, we can see that we add more functions to add ease, such as sorting for and searching for tenants, and creating/modifying files in app for each tenant.

Once the main functionality is complete, we will adjust the styles and buttons for accessibility and nice visuals. 

The current timeline for the app is one month and a half. With the first two weeks dedicated to core functionality and necessary testing and the last two to four weeks dedicated to styling, final testing and polishing.
